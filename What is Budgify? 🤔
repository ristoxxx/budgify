# What is Budgify? ü§î

Budgify is an online platform where multiple users can collaborate to create and manage a budget. 
In other words, it‚Äôs a tool that allows groups, companies, or teams to plan how they will spend their money in an organized and collaborative way, using artificial intelligence (AI) to assist throughout the entire process.
#How does Budgify work? ‚öôÔ∏è

1.Creating Budget Proposals
   Imagine a team wants to do several things with a limited budget. Each team member can propose how they would like to spend that money. These proposals are created within Budgify as ‚Äúspending ideas,‚Äù and AI helps organize these ideas so everyone can view and understand them more easily.

2. Real-Time Collaboration
   Once the proposals are on the platform, everyone can comment, vote, and give their opinions in real-time. If someone has a good suggestion to improve a proposal, they can add it right there. The platform updates automatically with each comment and vote, so everyone can see changes instantly.

3. Voting to Set Priorities
   Budgify features a voting system where each member can vote for the proposals they like best. This helps bring the most supported ideas to the top of the list, making them priority considerations. Instead of just one person deciding, the whole team has a voice in the budget.

4. Visualizing Results
   As team members vote and comment, Budgify shows the level of support for each proposal using colours to indicate whether it‚Äôs approved, rejected, or still under voting. This makes it easier to see which ideas have the most and least backing.

5. Making Final Decisions
   In the end, Budgify helps the team decide which proposals will become a reality. The proposals with the most votes become budget priorities, ensuring that the money is spent on the ideas that matter most to the group.
