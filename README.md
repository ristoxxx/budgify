# Full Description of the Project
The project is a collaborative platform designed to optimize budget management using artificial intelligence (AI). Its primary goal is to assist organizations and groups in creating, organizing, and managing budgets in a more efficient and transparent way. By leveraging AI, the platform streamlines the process, reduces errors, and automates many tasks that would otherwise require manual effort. This makes the budgeting process quicker, more accurate, and better organized, allowing members to focus on strategy rather than administrative tasks.


## Key Features
- Proposal Organization: Users can create, organize, and contribute to various budget proposals. The AI helps structure the proposals, ensuring they are logically organized and ready for collaboration.
- Voting Mechanism: Each member of the platform can vote on proposals. Votes reflect the level of support for specific proposals, helping to prioritize which ideas should be implemented.
- Comments and Feedback: Users can comment on proposals, suggesting adjustments or providing feedback. This enables dynamic discussions that refine proposals before final decisions are made.
- Real-time Scenario Visualization: The platform allows users to visualize multiple budgeting scenarios in real time. As proposals are voted on and modified, these changes are reflected instantly, helping members understand the impact of each decision.
- Popularity Indicators: The platform uses visual indicators, such as color codes, to show how popular or supported each proposal is. This adds a layer of transparency, making it clear which ideas have the most traction among members.

## Workflow
- Creation and Contribution:
Users can either create new budget proposals or join existing ones. Proposals are enhanced by AI, which suggests optimizations and structures them clearly for collaboration.
- Interactive Collaboration:
Members interact with the proposals in real time, providing comments, voting, and proposing adjustments. AI ensures that the discussion stays relevant and focused on feasible budget solutions.
- Real-time Updates:
As votes and comments come in, scenarios are updated in real time, allowing everyone involved to stay informed about the changes and see the evolving picture of the budget.
- Decision Making:
Through an organized system of voting, commenting, and real-time feedback, the group comes to a consensus on the most supported and viable proposals, which are then finalized and implemented.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
